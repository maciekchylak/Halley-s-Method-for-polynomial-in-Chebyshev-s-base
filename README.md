## Halley's Method for polynomial in Chebyshev's base

Project made for Numerical Methods whole by myself.

It is launched by using metodaHalleya function, where you have to special arguments outlined in the file.

Sprawozdanie contains statement in Polish about using this function. Addictionaly, it contains tests of this function.
